                <hr>
                <p>March is being observed as Fire Prevention Month here in the Philippines a perfect time to discuss and raise awareness about the causes, hazards, and dangers of fire.
                    By virtue of Proclamation No. 115-A, signed by then-President Ferdinand E. Marcos, and Proclamation No. 360 in 1986, the month of March was declared as “Fire Prevention Month” or “Burn Prevention Month.”
                    The fire prevention month campaign, according to the measure, promotes safety consciousness among our people every day of the year as a positive preventive approach to a problem that can be solved by more caution, vigilance, sobriety, the exercise of common sense, and respect for the law.”
                    State weather bureau PAGASA said the temperature and humidity in March start to reach higher levels, with the hot, dry weather causing a rise in reported fire cases around the country.
                    March is one of the hottest months of the year and it marks the beginning of the summer season in the Philippines. It is also the month that has one of the most alarming fire incidents in the country, based on data by the Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP).
                    As we observe this advocacy campaign, we should exercise vigilance and be more aware and knowledgeable about fire prevention to keep ourselves and our family safe.

                <h2><b>History</b></h2>
                <hr>
                <p>Fire Prevention Week was started by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) in 1922 to commemorate the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. Fire Prevention Week teaches children and adults how to stay safe in the event of a fire. In 1925, President Calvin Coolidge proclaimed the first National Fire Prevention Week to occur from October 4th through October 10th, 1925. President Calvin Coolidge stated that, “This waste results from the conditions which justify a sense of shame and horror; for the greater part of it could and ought to be prevented… It is highly desirable that every effort be made to reform the conditions which have made possible so vast a destruction of the national wealth”.
                </p>
                <p>The Great Chicago Fire burned between October 8th to October 10th, with most of the damage done on October 9th. The fire caused roughly $200 million in damages, killing around 300 people, and destroying over 17,000 buildings and structures. The consequences were more than just fire damage itself, as martial law had to be declared after an outbreak of looting and lawlessness. The fire was said to have started when a cow kicked over a lantern in the O’Leary barn in the southwest side of the city. Fortunately, in 1997, the Chicago City Council passed a resolution exonerating Catherine O’Leary, as well as her cow. Today, the Chicago Fire Department Training Academy is located on the site of the O’Leary property where the fire started.

                <hr>
                <p>Fire incidents are potentially deadly and very dangerous, but by following these safety precautions from authorities, we can prevent untoward incidents from happening. Just remember that having the presence of mind in any situation can also spell the difference between being a victim and being a fire survivor.
                    In line with educating the public on fire prevention, the BFP also encourages everyone to get involved and actively participate in fire drills conducted by barangays, schools, place of employment, and local government units. Fire drills are essential and allows everyone the chance to rehearse proper evacuation procedures. These also train participants to behave rationally amidst the crisis. Keep safe.
